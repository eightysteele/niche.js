== Overview ==

The goal of this project is to experiment with species niche modeling in JavaScript.

This idea came from Andrew Hill (Vizzuality) at [EcoHackNYC](http://www.ecohacknyc.org). It was presented as an igite talk ([video](http://vimeo.com/31709081) or  [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/jatorre/aaron-steele-using-visualraster-to-explore-worldclim-data)) on Friday night and was hacked on all day Saturday.

This project will leverage some cool techniques being developed at Vizzuality, including VisualRaster:
